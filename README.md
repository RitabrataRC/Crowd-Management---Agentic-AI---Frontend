## üì¶ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) (v20 or later recommended)
*   `npm` or a compatible package manager
*   A [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) project
*   A [MapTiler](https://maptiler.com/) account for an API key

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add the following configuration keys. Replace the placeholder values with your actual keys from Firebase and MapTiler.

```env
# Firebase Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=AIza...
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-project-id.firebaseapp.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-project-id.appspot.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=...
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=1:...:web:...

# MapTiler API Key
NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPTILER_API_KEY=your_maptiler_api_key

# Google AI (for Genkit)
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
```

### 4. Seed the Database (Optional but Recommended)

To populate your Firestore database with initial data for guards, medical staff, and ambulances, run the provided seed scripts:

```bash
# Seed the database with medical staff
npm run db:seed

# Seed the database with ambulance data
npm run db:seed:ambulances
```
You will also need to manually add an `admin` and a `users` collection to your Firestore database with at least one document each to test the login functionality.

### 5. Run the Application

This project requires two separate processes to be running concurrently: the Next.js frontend and the Genkit AI development server.

1.  **Start the Backend API:**
    Ensure your separate Python-based video and alert processing API is running on `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

2.  **Start the Genkit Dev Server:**
    In a new terminal, run:
    ```bash
    npm run genkit:watch
    ```
    This will start the Genkit development server and watch for changes in your AI flows.

3.  **Start the Next.js Frontend:**
    In another terminal, run:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    This will start the frontend development server, typically on `http://localhost:9002`.

Open your browser to `http://localhost:9002` to see the application in action!
